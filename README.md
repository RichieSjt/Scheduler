# Scheduler
An operating system scheduler simulator developed as a project for the Operatng Systems course.

## Functionality
**A program that reads from a text file processes that will enter a scheduler simulator. 
The scheduler will generate a table where detailed information about each process execution can be visualized.**

The processes must be defined in a txt file. The file shall be defined as follows:
- Each line indicates a process with its corresponding data separated by spaces.
- The first data is the process name, must be unique.
- The second data is the process execution time.
- The third data is the time at which the process was sent to the scheduler.

To visualize the graphical user interface run the ```main.py``` file with Python, input the required data in the fields and click on the generate table button.
The test1.txt and test2.txt files are examples of defined processes.
